The DataFrames and train/test split are too large to upload to GitHub directly. Instead, refer to this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I_cx5JIqfxZrggeCOu8VvdI0vYuyF-lV?usp=drive_link). 

The .csv files corresponding to each dimension reduction technique can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zQ3NmWUuRD3NsNuKIsvRgbIx8xLeHGSR).
